# CMPT 433 Sample Assignment Build Structure with LCD Support

This is a working project that you can use as the basis for your assignments and includes LCD support.


## Running on Target

* Install library dependencies on target:
  `(byai)$ sudo apt install liblgpio-dev libglib2.0-0`
* At each boot you'll need to either:
  a. Change the SPI to be usable by anyone:
     `sudo chmod a+rw /dev/spidev0.*`
  b. Run the program with root access.

## Structure

- `hal/`:   Contains all low-level hardware abstraction layer (HAL) modules
- `app/`:   Contains all application-specific code. Broken into modules and a main file
- `build/`: Generated by CMake; stores all temporary build files (may be deleted to clean)
- `lcd/`:   Library for LCD use from https://www.waveshare.com/
- `lgpio/`: Library used by LCD code, from https://github.com/joan2937/lg/archive/master.zip
            (No need to install the library on the host)
- `binc/`: Bluez_inc bluetooth helper library from https://github.com/weliem/bluez_inc
- `test/`: Executables for testing modules

## Building
- Configure cross compiling:
```
sudo dpkg --add-architecture arm64
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential crossbuild-essential-arm64 cmake`
```
- Install build dependencies:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libgpiod-dev:arm64 libglib2.0-dev:arm64 libdbus-1-dev libreadline-dev
```
- When you first open the project, click the "Build" button in the status bar for CMake to generate the `build\` folder and recreate the makefiles.
  - When you edit and save a CMakeLists.txt file, VS Code will automatically update this folder.
- When you add a new file (.h or .c) to the project, you'll need to rerun CMake's build
  (Either click "Build" or resave `/CMakeLists.txt` to trigger VS Code re-running CMake)
- Cross-compile using VS Code's CMake addon:
  - The "kit" defines which compilers and tools will be run.
  - Change the kit via the menu: Help > Show All Commands, type "CMake: Select a kit".
    - Kit "GCC 10.2.1 arm-linux-gnueabi" builds for target.
    - Kit "Unspecified" builds for host (using default `gcc`).
  - Most CMake options for the project can be found in VS Code's CMake view (very left-hand side).
- Build the project using Ctrl+Shift+B, or by the menu: Terminal > Run Build Task...
  - If you try to build but get an error about "build is not a directory", the re-run CMake's build as mentioned above.



## Address Sanitizer

- The address sanitizer built into gcc/clang is very good at catching memory access errors.
- Enable it by uncomment the `fsanitize=address` lines in the root CMakeFile.txt.
- For this to run on the BeagleBone, you must run:
  `sudo apt install libasan6`
  - Without this installed, you'll get an error:   
    "error while loading shared libraries: libasan.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"

## Suggested addons

- "CMake Tools" automatically suggested when you open a `CMakeLists.txt` file
- "Output Colourizer" by IBM 
    --> Adds colour to the OUTPUT panel in VS Code; useful for seeing CMake messages

## Manually Running CMake

To manually run CMake from the command line use:

```shell
  # Regenerate build/ folder and makefiles:
  rm -rf build/         # Wipes temporary build folder
  cmake -S . -B build   # Generate makefiles in build\

  # Build (compile & link) the project
  cmake --build build
```

## Finer Points

- When using the header files in HAL, you'll need to:  
  `#include "hal/myfile.h`  
  This extra "hal/..." helps distinguish the low-level access from the higher-level code.
- One only need to run the CMake build the first time the project loads, and each time the .h and .c file names change, or new ones are added, or ones are removed. This regenerates the `build/Makefile`. Otherwise, just run a normal build (ctrl+shift+B)
- If desired, one could provide an alternative implementation for the HAL modules that provides a software simulation of the hardware! This could be a useful idea if you have some complex hardware, or limited access to some hardware.
